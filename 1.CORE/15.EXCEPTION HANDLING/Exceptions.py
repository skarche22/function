# Errors are the problems in a program due to which the program will stop the execution.
# On the other hand, exceptions are raised when some internal events occur which changes the normal flow of the program.

# Difference between Syntax Error and Exceptions
# Syntax Error: As the name suggests this error is caused by the wrong syntax in the code.
# It leads to the termination of the program.

# x=100
# if x==100                 ##Here invalid syntax
#     print("Hello")

# Exceptions: Exceptions are raised when the program is syntactically correct, but the code resulted in an error.
# This error does not stop the execution of the program, however, it changes the normal flow of the program.

# ZeroDivisionError
# TypeError
# ValueError
# FileNotFoundError
# EOFError
# SleepingError
# TyrePuncturedError
