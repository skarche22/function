OPERATORS: Are the special symbols. Eg- + , * , /, etc.
OPERAND: It is the value on which the operator is applied.

Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to performing mathematical operations like
 addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

PRECEDENCE:
P – Parentheses
E – Exponentiation
M – Multiplication     (Multiplication and division have the same precedence)
D – Division
A – Addition     (Addition and subtraction have the same precedence)
S – Subtraction

## Comparison of Relational operators compares the values.
 It either returns True or False according to the condition.

 = is an assignment operator and == comparison operator.

## Logical Operators
Logical operators perform Logical AND, Logical OR, and Logical NOT operations.
 It is used to combine conditional statements.

##Bitwise operators act on bits and perform the bit-by-bit operations.
 These are used to operate on binary numbers.

## is and is not are the identity operators both are used to check if two values are
 located on the same part of the memory.


##Ternary operators are also known as conditional expressions are operators that evaluate something based on a condition being true or false.
It simply allows testing a condition in a single line replacing the multiline if-else making the code compact.

Syntax :

[on_true] if [expression] else [on_false]
